# DogBreedClassifier-Udacity_DLND_P2
Dog Breed Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Overview of the project
```Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, to make important design decisions about the user experience !.```
```to understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.``` 
```Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.```
